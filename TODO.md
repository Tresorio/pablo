**TODO's:**

    On Pablo:
        - Automatic refresh of UI (user information, renderpacks and user's renders)
        - Include more output formats and engines (Renderman ?)
        - Add a way for the user to compose its farm ?

    On Gandalf:
        - Fix credit debit (way more than expected atm)
        - Add a way to loadBalance using single frame separation

    On Paulette:
        - Add a way to upload renders as they appear
        - Add a way to merge multiple frame fragments into one
