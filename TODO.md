**TODO's:**

    On Pablo:
        - On hover description of render pack -> dont use Collection property
        - More explicit error notifications (popup box)
        - Move the bar reports message directly in the ui / popup
        - Send the last line of logs to blender (so the user can see what happens) ?
        - Have an option to enable the plugin in every .blend of the user
        - Store the render results as HDR (for example) so we can convert to any other file format later
        - Figure out what happens if multiple addons use the asyncio module (and async_loop code)

        - Set the language according to blender
        - Alias bpy.data.wm['WinMan'] (at least try it)
        - read = True : naming not so explicit

    On Gandalf:
        - Fix credit debit (way more than expected atm)
        - Add a way to loadBalance using single frame separation

    On Paulette:
        - Add a way to upload renders as they appear
        - Add a way to merge multiple frame fragments into one

**Legals:**

    - Credit the authors of the icons (actually get our own icons would be better)
