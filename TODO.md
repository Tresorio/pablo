**TODO's:**

    On Pablo:
        - Fix total number of frame (selected render)
        - On hover description of render pack -> dont use Collection property
        - Send the last line of logs to blender (so the user can see what happens) ?
        - Figure out what happens if multiple addons use the asyncio module (and async_loop code)
        - Store the render results as HDR (for example) so we can convert to any other file format later

    On Gandalf:
        - Fix credit debit (way more than expected atm)
        - Add a way to loadBalance using single frame separation

    On Paulette:
        - Add a way to upload renders as they appear
        - Add a way to merge multiple frame fragments into one

**Legals:**

    - Credit the authors of the icons (actually get our own icons would be better)
